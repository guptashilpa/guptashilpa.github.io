One of my passion project outside of work is volunteering with [More Active Girls In Computing](https://www.getmagic.org) to encourage middle and high school girls to pursue STEM careers by 1:1 mentoring on a hands-on project by a female role model. 

**We are always looking for mentors**. 
If you are interested and want to know more, please book a time on my calendar by clicking the link below.
