We explored definition, current practices around authentic assessment and produced the following artifacts.\nFinal Presentation This presentation summarises the findings on the group’s research and discussion on authentic assessment.\nWhere do I start This document provides tips and suggestions to incorporating authentic assessment in your course\nInitial Faculty Survey Results The research subgroup conducted survey among the SJSU faculty. This dashboard summarises early results we have observed. The response rate is less than 2% at this time. We plan to revisit the survey later in the summer. The survey follows the IRB protocols and was approved prior to dissemination.\n\n\n\n",

In this course we will learn basics of data loading, wrangling, visualizing and analysis using R and Python for variety of real- world data. We will be only scratching the surface but my hope is that is enough to ignite your curiosity and drive to go forth and make impactful contributions to our society using these skills.\nWhy both R and Python\nBeing multilingual is good for cognition and job marketability\nBoth are open source with active communities\nGeneral Purpose vs {Build by and for Statisticians}\nData Munging speed vs {ease of exploratory data analysis + statistical analysis + data visualization} (Note: though the gap is closing between the two rapidly)\nR in python code → Rpy2 and Python in R code → reticulate\nIDEs used\nJupyter Notebook via Anaconda distribution\nRStudio\nLibraries covered\nPython\nnumpy, pandas, matplotlib, dash, sqlite3\nIn limited capacity: statsmodel, scipy\nR\ntidyverse, lubridate, ggplot2, rmarkdown, flexdashboard, sqlite, reticulate\nAdditional\ngit and github\ndeploy flexdashboard on shinyapps.io\n\n\n\n",
