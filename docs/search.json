We explored definition, current\npractices around authentic assessment and produced the following\nartifacts.\nFinal\nPresentation This presentation summarises the findings on\nthe group’s research and discussion on authentic assessment.\nWhere\ndo I start This document provides tips and suggestions to\nincorporating authentic assessment in your course\nInitial Faculty\nSurvey Results The research subgroup conducted survey among\nthe SJSU faculty. This dashboard summarises early results we have\nobserved. The response rate is less than 2% at this time. We plan to\nrevisit the survey later in the summer. The survey follows the IRB\nprotocols and was approved prior to dissemination.\n\n\n\n",
