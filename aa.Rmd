[**Initial Faculty Survey Results**](https://ise194.shinyapps.io/aadash/)
The research subgroup conducted survey among the SJSU faculty. This dashboard summarises early results we have observed. The response rate is less than 2% at this time. We plan to revisit the survey later in the summer. The survey follows the IRB protocols and was approved prior to dissemination.
